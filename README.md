# Implementation of Decision Tree and KNN
This is an assignment for the course TDT4300 called datawarehouse and datamining at NTNU

In this assignment we are supposed to classify poisonous mushrooms using decision tree classifier and K-nearest neighborhood. Both classification implementations consists of an evaluation of the classificiations as well. The implementation of the algorithms has their own jupyter notebook. 

* Decision tree: <code>decision_tree_classifier.ipynb</code>
* K-nearest neighborhood: <code>knn_classifier.ipynb</code>
