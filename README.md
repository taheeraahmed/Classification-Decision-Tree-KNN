# Implementation of Decision Tree and KNN
This is an assignment for the course TDT4300 called datawarehouse and datamining at NTNU

In this assignment we are supposed to classify poisonous mushrooms using both decision tree classifier and K-nearest neighborhood. Both of the implementation consists of an evaluation of classificiations. The implementation of the algorithms has their own jupyter notebook. 
* Decision tree: <code>decision_tree_classifier.ipynb</code>
* K-nearest neighborhood: <code>knn_classifier.ipynb</code> consists of the algorithm for classification and evaluation of the predictions
